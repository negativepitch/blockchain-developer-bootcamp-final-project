# Decentralized Vehicle History #
### Problem ###
With used vehicle prices at an all time high, it's never been more important to know a vehicle's history before making a purchasing decision. While there are services that already seek to provide this information, there are a few important problems that a decentralized ledger could solve:
- Large vehicle history providers such as *Carfax* are private, centralized entities with the goal of maximizing profits, not necessarily generating accurate data
- These service providers are oftentimes behind a paywall which requires a vehicle's history to be purchased instead of shared freely
- A vehicle owner has no ability to input data into the history report (e.g. regular maintenance date and mileage, vehicle modifications, service center details, ...etc.)
### Ethereum Blockchain to the Rescue ###
The Decentralized Vehicle History app will solve the problem of the privatization of vehicle history by allowing owners and interested parties to post vehicle updates to the blockchain using the unique vehicle identification number (VIN).
